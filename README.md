The beauty of Elm is not only your life becomes free of runtime errors and maintaining apps becomes trivial, but also the absense of a build ecosystem. So `run` file contains a tiny bash script with aliases to build and development commands. I am using `elm-live` (https://github.com/wking-io/elm-live) for auto build->refresh cycle when developing locally.

# Develop
`./run dev`

# Build
`./run build`
